There is also a Visitors Center there if you would like to pick up some maps, local travel guides, etc. to read on your way to the apartment.  If you need a local SIM card, there is a 7-11 in the middle section  of the main arrival hall where they see all types of SIM cards, I usually prefer the PCCW brand as it is the larges local operator.","transit":"Minibuses and buses stop all along Caine Road (a minute walk away) that will take you to Causewaybay, Central, WanChai and beyond.

I am a massive festival fan, I love the health and wellness side of festivals and well as the music and vibe of so many happy people in one place.  As a festival organizer I see it as my duty to enjoy as many as possible :)   Josef is a creative with a touch of tech genius, he loves drawing and star gazing in his spare time.  We love eating vegetarian food, listening to electronic music and going out with friends.
